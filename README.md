# Analyzing-the-usage-of-electricity-in-USA
We use electricity to power our electronics, our A/C during hot summer days, and across various means of transportations. There are many ways to generate electricity from fossil fuels, hydroelectric generators, and wind turbines. We want to analyze the revenue, sales, and prices of electricity in different areas (i.e. Residential, Commercial, Industrial, and Transportation) across each state in the United States of America. By revenue, we mean the earnings made by the state. Sales indicate the electricity usage in Megawatts per hour by each state. The data shows the electricity price or cost in Cents per kilowatts per hour.
